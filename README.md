# BBN_Assignment
This repository contains the code and files for a data analytics project focused on predicting bacteriological failure in water distribution systems using machine learning and probabilistic modelling techniques.

üìÅ Contents:
EDA_Logistic_Model.Rmd: R Notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, and logistic regression modelling.

BBN_Model.xdsl: Bayesian Belief Network model file created in GeNIe using a Naive Bayes structure.

preprocessed_data.csv: Cleaned and feature-selected dataset used for both models.

üß† Project Summary:
The goal was to support Scottish Water in identifying key risk factors for water quality failures. Logistic regression was used as a statistical baseline, while the BBN enabled scenario-based reasoning and sensitivity analysis for rare event prediction.
